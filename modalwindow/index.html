      <h1>one of my favourite quotes 😍</h1>
      <p>
        “If you think you are beaten, you are, If you think you dare not, you
        don't If you like to win, but you think you can't, It is almost certain
        you won't. “If you think you'll lose, you're lost, For out in the world
        we find, Success begins with a fellow's will— It's all in the state of
        mind. “If you think you are outclassed, you are, You've got to think
        high to rise, You've got to be sure of yourself before You can ever win
        a prize. “Life's battles don't always go To the stronger or faster man,
        But soon or late the man who wins Is the man WHO THINKS HE CAN!” ―
        Napoleon Hill, Think and Grow Rich
